# ML-Project-Diabetes_Prediction
Project Description:
Developed a machine learning model to predict diabetes using a dataset with 768 rows and 9 columns. Utilized **NumPy** and **Pandas** for data handling, **sklearn.preprocessing** for data standardization, and **sklearn.model_selection** for train-test splitting. Implemented an **SVM (Support Vector Machine)** classifier, achieving an accuracy of **77.2%**. Evaluated model performance using **sklearn.metrics**. The project demonstrates expertise in data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation for healthcare predictions.
